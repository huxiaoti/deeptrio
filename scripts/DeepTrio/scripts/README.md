<!-- # Motivation
Protein-protein interaction (PPI), as a relative property, depends on two binding proteins of it, which brings a great challenge to design an expert model with unbiased learning and superior generalization performance. Additionally, few efforts have been made to grant models discriminative insights on relative properties. -->
### Installation

It is recommended to install dependencies in **conda** virtual environment so that only few installation commands are required for running DeepTrio. 
You can prepare all the dependencies just by the following commands.

- Install Miniconda

    > Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others

    1. Download Miniconda installer for linux : https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers
    2. Check the hashes for the Miniconda from : https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda_hashes.html
    3. Go to the installation directory and run command : `bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`

- Creating the environment

    If there is no environment in your Miniconda environment, it is recommeneded to create a new environment to run DeepTrio.

    1. Run `conda create -n [your env name] python=3.7`
    2. Run `conda activate [your env name]`
    3. Run `conda install tensorflow-gpu==2.1`
    4. Run `conda install seaborn`
    5. Run `conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn`
    6. Run `conda install -c conda-forge gpyopt`
    7. Run `conda install -c conda-forge dotmap`
### Run DeepTrio for Training

1. To run DeepSol on your own training data you need to prepare the following two things:

    * Protein-protein Interaction File: A pure protein ID file, in which two protein IDs are separated by the **Tab** key, alonge with their label (1 for 'interacting', 0 for 'non-interacting' and 2 for 'single protein'). For example:

      ```txt
      line1:    protein_id_1  [Tab]  protein_id_2  [Tab]  label
      line2:    protein_id_3  [Tab]  protein_id_4  [Tab]  label
      ```

    * Protein Sequence Database File: A file containing protein IDs and their sequences in fasta format, which are separated by the **Tab** key. For example:
   
      ```txt
      line1:    protein_id_1  [Tab]  protein_1_sequence  
      line2:    protein_id_3  [Tab]  protein_2_sequence
      ```
2. Execute command with arguments in shell:

    ```shell
    python build_model.py [-h] -p PPI -d DATABASE [-e EPOCH]
    ```
    **Arguments:**

    |Abbreviation|Argument|Required|Description|
    |  ----   | ----  | ----  |----  |
    | -p  | --ppi | Yes | PPI file with its path|
    | -d  | --database | Yes | Database file with its path|
    | -e  | --epoch | No | The maximum number of epochs|
    | -h  | --help | No | Help message|

   You can alternatively run `build_model_fast.py` without hyper-parameter searching:

    ```shell
    python build_model_fast.py [-h] -p PPI -d DATABASE -i FOLD [-e EPOCH]
    ```
    **Arguments:**

    |Abbreviation|Argument|Required|Description|
    |  ----   | ----  | ----  |----  |
    | -p  | --ppi | Yes | PPI file with its path|
    | -d  | --database | Yes | Database file with its path|
    | -i  | --fold | Yes | The fold index in 5-fold CV (from 0 to 4)|
    | -e  | --epoch | No | The maximum number of epochs|
    | -h  | --help | No | Help message|
    
3. Select the best model according to **GpyOpt** log file:

    ```txt
    DeepTrio_search_1.h5
    DeepTrio_search_2.h5
    DeepTrio_search_3.h5
    DeepTrio_search_4.h5
    ...
    search_log.txt
    ```
    * The `search_log.txt` shows the details of all the candidate models' parameters and the best model parameters.

    ```txt
    result: 
        parameter   em_dim:         15.0
        parameter   sp_drop:        0.005
        parameter   kernel_rate_1:  0.16
        ...
        evaluation: 0.9795729
    ```
4. Use the DeepTrio model to predict PPIs.


### Run DeepTrio for Prediction
1. To run DeepSol for prediction on your own query protein pairs you need to prepare the following three things:

    * The first protein File: It can contain multiple proteins in fasta format. For example:

      ```txt
      line1:    >protein_id_1
      line2:    protein_1_sequence
      line3:    >protein_id_2
      line4:    protein_2_sequence
      ```

    * The second protein File: It can contain multiple proteins in fasta format. For example:
   
      ```txt
      line1:    >protein_id_3
      line2:    protein_3_sequence
      ```
    
    * The model file name and its path. 

    * The inputs of DeepTrio will be:

      ```txt
      the first query protein pair:   protein_1 and protein_3
      the second query protein pair:  protein_2 and protein_3
      ```

2. Execute command with arguments in shell:

    ```shell
    python main.py [-h] -p1 PROTEIN1 -p2 PROTEIN2 -m MODEL [-o OUTPUT]
    ```
    **Arguments:**

    |Abbreviation|Argument|Required|Description|
    |  ----   | ----  | ----  |----  |
    | -p1  | --protein1 | Yes | The first protein group in fasta format with its path|
    | -p2  | --protein2 | Yes | The second protein group in fasta format with its path|
    | -m | --model | Yes | The DeepTrio model with its path|
    | -o | --output | No | The output file name|
    | -h  | --help | No | Help message|

### Run DeepTrio for Visualization
1. To run DeepSol for visualization on your own query protein pairs you need to prepare the following three things:

    * The first protein File: which must contain only one protein in fasta format. For example:

      ```txt
      line1:    >protein_id_1
      line2:    protein_1_sequence
      ```

    * The second protein File: which must contain only one protein, like `the first protein File`. 

    * The model file name and its path.

2. Execute command with arguments in shell:

    ```shell
    python visual_DeepTrio.py [-h] -p1 PROTEIN1 -p2 PROTEIN2 -m MODEL
    ```
    **Arguments:**

    |Abbreviation|Argument|Required|Description|
    |  ----   | ----  | ----  |----  |
