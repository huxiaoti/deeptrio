<!-- # Motivation
Protein-protein interaction (PPI), as a relative property, depends on two binding proteins of it, which brings a great challenge to design an expert model with unbiased learning and superior generalization performance. Additionally, few efforts have been made to grant models discriminative insights on relative properties. -->

## Installation

It is recommended to install dependencies in **conda** virtual environment so that only few installation commands are required for running DeepTrio. 
You can prepare all the dependencies just by the following commands.

- Install Miniconda

    > Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others

    1. Download Miniconda installer for linux : https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers
    2. Check the hashes for the Miniconda from : https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda_hashes.html
    3. Go to the installation directory and run command : `bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`

- Creating the environment

    If there is no environment in your Miniconda environment, it is recommeneded to create a new environment to run DeepTrio.

    1. Run `conda create -n [your env name] python=3.7`
    2. Run `conda activate [your env name]`
    3. Run `pip install --upgrade pip`
    4. ~~Run conda install tensorflow-gpu=2.1~~  
       **WARNING: Using TensorFlow < 2.6.0 may have worse performance with the latest GPU like A100, and it is recommended to use pip to install the latest TensorFlow e.g. 2.12.0)**  
       Run `pip install --upgrade tensorflow`
    5. Run `conda install seaborn`
    6. Run `conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn`
    7. Run `conda install -c conda-forge gpyopt`
    8. Run `conda install -c conda-forge dotmap`

### Run DeepTrio for Training

1. To run DeepTrio on your own training data you need to prepare the following two things:

    * Protein-protein Interaction File: A pure protein ID file, in which two protein IDs are separated by the **Tab** key, along with their label (1 for 'interacting', and 0 for 'non-interacting'). 

      ```txt
      line1:    protein_id_1  [Tab]  protein_id_2  [Tab]  label
      line2:    protein_id_3  [Tab]  protein_id_4  [Tab]  label
      ```

    * Protein Sequence Database File: A file containing protein IDs and their sequences in fasta format, which are separated by the **Tab** key. 
     
      ```txt
      line1:    protein_id_1  [Tab]  protein_1_sequence

For example:~~

      ```txt
      line1:    protein_id_1  [Tab]  protein_id_2  [Tab]  label
